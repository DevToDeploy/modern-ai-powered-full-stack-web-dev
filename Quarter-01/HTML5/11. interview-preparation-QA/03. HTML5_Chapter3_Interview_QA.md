## Questions 1–35

### 1. What is the difference between `<ol>` and `<ul>` in HTML5?
**Answer:** `<ol>` creates an **ordered list** where items have a sequence (numbered), while `<ul>` creates an **unordered list** where items have bullets. Use `<ol>` for steps or sequences, `<ul>` for lists without importance in order.
```html
<ol>
  <li>Step 1</li>
  <li>Step 2</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>Apples</li>
  <li>Bananas</li>
</ul>
```
**Follow-up:** When should you use `<ol>` with the `type` attribute?
**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Practical Tip:** Always ensure ordered lists reflect real order; misusing `<ul>` or `<ol>` can confuse screen readers.

### 2. How do you customize numbering styles in `<ol>`?
**Answer:** Using the `type` attribute (`1`, `A`, `a`, `I`, `i`) or CSS `list-style-type`. Example:
```html
<ol type="A">
  <li>Apple</li>
  <li>Banana</li>
</ol>
```
**Follow-up:** Explain when `start` attribute is useful in production.
**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Tip:** Use CSS for consistency across browsers instead of only `type` attribute.

### 3. How does the `start` attribute work in `<ol>`?
**Answer:** It sets the starting number of an ordered list.
```html
<ol start="5">
  <li>Item 5</li>
  <li>Item 6</li>
</ol>
```
**Follow-up:** How can this affect accessibility?
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Tip:** Screen readers announce numbers starting from `start` value, so always check accessibility.

### 4. What are nested lists and why are they used?
**Answer:** Lists inside another list, useful for hierarchical data.
```html
<ul>
  <li>Fruits
    <ul>
      <li>Apple</li>
      <li>Banana</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
```
**Follow-up:** How can deep nesting affect mobile rendering?
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Tip:** Avoid deep nesting (>3 levels) to maintain readability and UX.

### 5. How do you remove bullets from an unordered list?
**Answer:** Use CSS `list-style-type:none`.
```html
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li>Item 1</li>
</ul>
```
**Follow-up:** What accessibility considerations arise if bullets are removed?
**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Tip:** Consider adding visual indicators for screen readers if bullets are removed.

### 6. Explain the `<dl>`, `<dt>`, and `<dd>` tags.
**Answer:** `<dl>` is a **definition list**, `<dt>` is the term, `<dd>` is the description.
```html
<dl>
  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dd>Markup language for web pages</dd>
</dl>
```
**Follow-up:** How would you use `<dl>` for FAQs?
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Tip:** Semantic use improves SEO and accessibility.

### 7. What common mistakes do developers make with nested lists?
**Answer:** Missing closing tags, improper indentation, using `<ul>` when `<ol>` is intended, deep nesting without UX plan.
**Follow-up:** How can you debug nested list issues in production?
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Tip:** Validate HTML and test with dev tools for nested list rendering.

### 8. Difference between `<ol>` with `type="1"` vs default?
**Answer:** Default is `1` already, so explicitly setting is redundant but may improve readability or consistency.
**Follow-up:** When should CSS `list-style-type` be preferred over HTML `type`?
**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Tip:** Use CSS to maintain separation of structure and styling.

### 9. How can lists improve accessibility?
**Answer:** Proper use of `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<dl>` ensures screen readers can parse items, especially hierarchical info.
**Follow-up:** How to check screen reader behavior with lists?
**Difficulty:** Advanced
**Tip:** Use tools like NVDA or VoiceOver to test.

### 10. How to create numbered lists with lowercase roman numerals?
**Answer:** Use `<ol type="i">` or CSS `list-style-type: lower-roman;`.
```html
<ol type="i">
  <li>First</li>
  <li>Second</li>
</ol>
```
**Follow-up:** How do you combine `start` with roman numerals?
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Tip:** Test across browsers as not all render roman numerals the same.

### 11. How do you style nested lists differently than parent lists?
**Answer:** Use CSS descendant selectors.
```css
ul ul { list-style-type: circle; }
ul ul ul { list-style-type: square; }
```
**Follow-up:** Why is using classes preferred over element selectors?
**Difficulty:** Advanced
**Tip:** Helps maintain predictable styles in large projects.

### 12. Explain semantic difference between `<ul>` and `<nav>` with lists.
**Answer:** `<ul>` is for lists in general, `<nav>` is for navigation context. Always wrap navigation links inside `<nav>` for semantics.
**Follow-up:** How does semantic HTML affect SEO?
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Tip:** Use `<nav>` + `<ul>` for menus to improve accessibility.

### 13. Can `<ul>` or `<ol>` contain `<p>` tags inside `<li>`?

```html
<ul>
  <li><p>Paragraph inside li</p></li>
</ul>
```
**Follow-up:** How might this affect styling?
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Tip:** Ensure spacing and indentation are correct for readability.

### 14. What is the difference between `<ol>` start="5"` and CSS counter-reset?
**Answer:** HTML `start` sets starting number for single list, CSS `counter-reset` allows custom counting for multiple lists.
**Follow-up:** When to prefer CSS counters?
**Difficulty:** Advanced
**Tip:** Use CSS counters for dynamic or multi-list numbering systems.

### 15. How do you add a description under multiple `<dt>` terms?
**Answer:** Multiple `<dt>` can share a single `<dd>`.
```html
<dl>
  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dt>HTML5</dt>
  <dd>Markup language for web pages</dd>
</dl>
```
**Follow-up:** How does this affect screen readers?
**Difficulty:** Advanced
**Tip:** Test with screen readers to ensure combined terms are read clearly.

### 16. How does `<ol reversed>` work?
**Answer:** Reverses the order of numbering in ordered lists.
```html
<ol reversed>
  <li>Step 3</li>
  <li>Step 2</li>
</ol>
```
**Follow-up:** Any browser compatibility concerns?
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Tip:** Test older browsers; some may not support `reversed`.

### 17. How to prevent list items from wrapping in horizontal navigation?
**Answer:** Use CSS `display: inline` or `flex`.
```css
ul li { display: inline; margin-right: 15px; }
```
**Follow-up:** When to prefer `flex` over `inline`?
**Difficulty:** Advanced
**Tip:** `flex` provides more control over alignment, spacing, and responsiveness.

  <li>Fruit
    <ul>
      <li>Apple</li>
      <li>Banana</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
```
**Follow-up:** Any impact on semantic meaning?

**Follow-up:** How to test?
**Difficulty:** Advanced
**Tip:** Use tools like axe or Lighthouse to audit accessibility.

### 24. Difference between `list-style-type` and `list-style-image`?
**Answer:** `list-style-type` uses bullets/numbers, `list-style-image` uses custom images.
```css
ul { list-style-image: url('bullet.png'); }
```
**Follow-up:** How does this affect accessibility?
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Tip:** Provide fallback text or styles if images fail to load.

### 25. How to prevent list item markers from inheriting parent styles?
**Answer:** Use CSS `list-style: initial;` or `list-style-type: disc;`.
