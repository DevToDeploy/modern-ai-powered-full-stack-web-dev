## 📚 Detailed Curriculum (18 Months \| 6 Quarters)

The program is structured into six intensive quarters, each building
upon the last to take you from fundamentals to advanced, real-world
application development.

### **Quarter 1: Web Development Fundamentals (Months 1-3)**

Master the foundational languages of the web. This quarter focuses on
building a rock-solid base in front-end development, ensuring you can
create responsive, interactive, and modern user interfaces.

-   **Core Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid), Responsive Design, and Advanced JavaScript (ES6+), including asynchronous operations (Promises, async/await) and API consumption (Fetch API).

-   **Key Skills:** DOM manipulation, version control with Git/GitHub, debugging, and handling JSON data.

-   **Project:** A professional, responsive portfolio website and a data-driven web application that consumes a third-party REST API.

### **Quarter 2: Advanced Frontend with React & Next.js (Months 4-6)**

Dive deep into the world\'s leading frontend library, React. You will
learn to build complex, stateful, and scalable single-page applications
(SPAs) and explore the power of server-side rendering with Next.js.

-   **Core Technologies:** React.js (Components, Hooks, State Management with Context API/Redux), React Router, and an introduction to Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).

-   **Key Skills:** Building dynamic UIs, managing component state, client-side routing, and deploying frontend applications to platforms like Vercel.

-   **Project:** A multi-page, scalable React application (e.g., a blog frontend) with global state management and routing.

### **Quarter 3: Backend Development & Full-Stack Integration (Months 7-9)**

Build the server-side of web applications. You will master Node.js and
Express.js to create robust REST APIs, manage data with MongoDB, and
implement secure user authentication.

-   **Core Technologies:** Node.js, Express.js (Middleware, Routing), MongoDB (NoSQL concepts, Mongoose schemas), and secure authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and OAuth.

-   **Key Skills:** Designing and building RESTful APIs, performing CRUD operations, implementing secure user login systems, and connecting a React frontend to a Node backend.

-   **Project:** A complete MERN stack application (e.g., a task manager or social media clone) with a secure, authenticated API and a functional user interface.

### **Quarter 4: DevOps, Security, and Intro to AI/ML (Months 10-12)**

Learn to deploy, manage, and secure your applications like a
professional. This quarter introduces you to DevOps practices and shifts
focus to the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning.

-   **Core Technologies:** Docker (containerization), CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), Cloud Hosting (AWS/GCP), Web Security best practices (HTTPS, CORS), and an introduction to ML with Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn).

-   **Key Skills:** Dockerizing applications, automating deployments, securing web applications against common threats, and understanding the core concepts of supervised vs. unsupervised learning.

-   **Project:** A fully dockerized MERN application with an automated CI/CD pipeline. You will also build and train a basic machine learning model in Python.

### **Quarter 5: Applied AI for Web & Advanced Frameworks (Months 13-15)**

This is where web development meets intelligence. Learn to integrate
powerful AI capabilities directly into your web applications using
browser-based machine learning and cutting-edge large language model
(LLM) APIs.

-   **Core Technologies:** TensorFlow.js for in-browser ML, OpenAI GPT-4/5 API integration, and LangChain for building intelligent agents and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.

-   **Key Skills:** Running ML models in the browser, building AI-powered chatbots, creating complex LLM workflows, and working with vector databases for semantic search.

-   **Project:** An application with a real-time image classifier using TensorFlow.js and a \"knowledge bot\" capable of answering questions from custom documents using LangChain.

### **Quarter 6: Capstone Project & Career Preparation (Months 16-18)**

Synthesize all your skills to build a final, portfolio-worthy project.
This quarter is dedicated to creating a production-ready, AI-powered
SaaS application while polishing your resume and preparing for the job
market.
